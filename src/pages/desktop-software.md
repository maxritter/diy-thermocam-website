**ThermoVision** is a **powerful desktop software** to view, **modify and convert raw images** created on the DIY-Thermocam V3. The **image browser** can show all images inside a folder, you can **edit them in various ways** and **export the outputs to an image file**. The software works under **Windows only** and is provided by a third party author. You can get more information about its capabilities on the [**authors site**](http://joe-c.de/pages/projekte/thermovision.php).

The standalone PC thermal live viewer software allows you to **capture** HQ **thermal** and **visual images**, as well as **videos** right on the **computer**.  Various **settings** can be **changed** over the UI, including a calibration and two **different transfer modes**. The software is written in **Python**, so it can be modified to your own needs and executed on **any OS**.

# Thermal Data Viewer

The second possibility to **view** and **edit the raw data** files right on the **PC**, is the thermal data viewer. It allows various functions to alter the thermal range, **add measurement points** as well as various filters. The program is also capable of **converting whole folders** of raw data frames into images (JPG, BMP or PNG) or avi videos. The **live tab** allows you to stream live images from the device and the calibration tab offers functions to edit the **raw-to-absolution temperature conversion**.

# Video Converter

The DIY-Thermocam allows to capture continous or time-lapse videos on the device, but they are still recorded as single frames and not merged into a single video (due to the limitatations of the microcontroller concerning modern video codecs). You can use the Video Converter to convert any number of frames from your internal storage into a movie file.

# Firmware Updater

To flash the newest firmware to the DIY-Thermocam over USB, use the Firmware Updater that works under Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.
