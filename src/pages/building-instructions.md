### Required Time

*   About 2-3 hours, depending on your previous experience with soldering

### Required Tools

*   Soldering iron

*   Some solder

*   Cutting pliers

*   Nippers 

*   Screwdriver 

*   Multimeter

### Building Steps

1\.

Solder two 24-pin male headers to the backside of the Teensy. Solder one 5-pin male header in the middle of those two headers and one 1-pin male header to the right side inside the VUSB pin:

##### 2.

Cut the connection between the two pads on the top of the Teensy with a sharp knife. Use a multimeter to check that they are really separated:

##### 3.

Insert a microSD card into the top side of the Teensy. It will be used as an internal storage and can be accessed via a PC as mass storage over the USB connection:

##### 4.

Stack four female headers on top of all the male headers from step 1. This avoids soldering the Teensy directly to the PCB and therefore simplifies any repairs or later adjustments:

##### 5.

Solder the Teensy with the female headers to the PCB. This is how it should look on the front:

##### 6.

And on the back where the solder connections are:

##### 7.

Put male headers into the charging module and solder it right to the Teensy. This is how it should look on the front:

##### 8.

And on the back:

##### 9.

Solder the 5V Booster module to the top right of the PCB. This is how it looks on the front:

11\.

Solder the 2x20 pin display header to the left of the PCB:

##### 12.

Solder the charging LED to the top right of the PCB with the short leg inside the hole "G":

##### 13.

Solder the six resistors into their respective place. This is how it looks on the front:

##### 14.

And this how it looks on the back:

##### 15.

Solder the coin cell holder to the bottom of the PCB, next to the charging module. Do not put in the battery yet. This is how it looks on the front:
