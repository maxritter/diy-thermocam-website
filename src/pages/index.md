      The aim of this project is to give private persons, educational institutes
      and companies access to a **portable,  affordable and customizable thermal
      imaging platform that is based on open-source software and hardware**.


      There are various applications like **finding heat leaks** in the
      insulation of buildings, the **analysis of electrical or mechanical
      components**, the detection of persons / animals or even **mounting it on
      a drone** and recording **continuous or time-lapse images**.

      Constructed as a **self-assembly solution**, the device allows you to take
      advantage of the versatile possibilities of thermal imaging. Both the
      software and hardware are open-source, allowing you to **modify or extend
      the functionalities of the device and the software ecosystem to your own
      needs**!

      The [**device
      firmware**](https://github.com/maxritter/DIY-Thermocam/releases) provides
      a lot of functionalities, that can be accessed over the **3.2" TFT LCD
      touch screen**. **Flashing the firmware** is easy and can be done without
      any programming knowledge on **any operating system** with the
      [**standalone firmware
      updater**](https://github.com/maxritter/DIY-Thermocam/tree/master/Software/Firmware%20Updater).


      The DIY-Thermocam offers a **wide range of features**, like adding
      **temperature points**, changing **temperature range limits**, displaying
      **hot or cold temperatures** only, **saving single images or a series of
      images** (video or timelapse) to the integrated storage, changing the
      **color scheme**, etc.


      In case you want to **extend the existing featureset** with your own
      functionality, that's possible too. The [**firmware of the
      DIY-Thermocam**](https://github.com/maxritter/DIY-Thermocam/tree/master/Firmware_V3)
      is completely **open-source** and is programmed in C++. Just download
      **Visual Studio Code** and the **PlatformIO extension**, and you are ready
      to go!
