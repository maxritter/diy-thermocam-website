      The aim of this project is to give private persons, educational institutes
      and companies access to a **portable,  affordable and customizable thermal
      imaging platform that is based on open-source software and hardware**.


      There are various applications like finding heat leaks in the insulation
      of buildings, the analysis of electrical or mechanical components, the
      detection of persons / animals or even mounting it on a drone and
      recording continuous or time-lapse images.


      Constructed as a self-assembly solution, the device allows you to take
      advantage of the versatile possibilities of thermal imaging. Both the
      software and hardware are open-source, allowing you to modify or extend
      the functionalities of the device and the software ecosystem to your own
      needs!
