      The **DIY-Thermocam V3** gives **private persons, educational institutes
      and companies** access to a **portable,  affordable and customizable
      thermal imaging platform** that is based on open-source
      [**software**](https://github.com/maxritter/diy-thermocam/tree/master/software)
      and
      [**hardware**](https://github.com/maxritter/diy-thermocam/tree/master/pcb).
      It is constructed as a [**self-assembly
      solution**](https://www.diy-thermocam.net/building-instructions), that can be
      build **at home** by only using **some standard tools**.


      There are [**various
      applications**](https://www.diy-thermocam.net/thermal-images) like
      **finding heat leaks** in the insulation of buildings, the **analysis of
      electrical or mechanical components**, the **detection of persons /
      animals** or even **mounting it on a drone** and recording **continuous or
      time-lapse images**.

      The device has a [**large ecosystem of
      software**](https://www.diy-thermocam.net/software) around it, that allows
      to **extend the functionalities of the device** beyond the firmware
      itself. You can use the [**Thermal Analysis 
      Software**](https://github.com/maxritter/diy-thermocam/tree/master/software/thermal_analysis_software/)
      to **edit raw data files on your PC** and **save them in various file
      formats**. In addition to that, the [**Thermal Live
      Viewer**](https://github.com/maxritter/diy-thermocam/tree/master/software/thermal_live_viewer/)
      can **stream live thermal images to your PC**, change settings on the fly
      and **record images or videos**. The [**Thermal Data
      Viewer**](https://github.com/maxritter/diy-thermocam/tree/master/software/thermal_data_viewer/)
      provides another way of **editing raw files**, and with the [**Video
      Converter**](https://github.com/maxritter/diy-thermocam/tree/master/software/video_converter)
      you can **convert series of captures images to movie files**.

      The [**Device
      Firmware**](https://github.com/maxritter/diy-thermocam/releases) provides
      a lot of functionalities, that can be accessed over the **3.2" TFT LCD
      touch screen**. **Flashing the firmware** is easy and can be done without
      any programming knowledge on **any operating system** over the command line interface.
      Once the Thermocam is **connected to the PC**, it will show up as a **mass
      storage device** and allows you to **transfer thermal images from or to
      the device**.


      The DIY-Thermocam offers a **wide range of features**, like adding
      **temperature points**, changing **temperature range limits**, displaying
      **hot or cold temperatures** only, **saving single images or a series of
      images** (video or timelapse) to the integrated storage, changing the
      **color scheme**, etc. It can also **communicate to the PC** over the
      [**USB serial
      protocol**](https://www.diy-thermocam.net/docs/serial/),
      in order to **stream thermal images** or **change settings remotely**.


      In case you want to **extend the existing featureset** with your own
      functionality, that's possible too. The [**firmware of the
      DIY-Thermocam**](https://github.com/maxritter/diy-thermocam/tree/master/firmware)
      is completely **open-source** and written in C/C++. Just download **Visual
      Studio Code** and the **PlatformIO extension**, and you are ready to go!
