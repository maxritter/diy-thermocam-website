      **Version 3** has been redesigned to offer **3x the performance** of the
      predecessor, making **thermal imaging much more accessible and fun**!


      The aim of this project is to give **private persons**, **educational
      institutes** and **companies** access to a **portable**,  **affordable**
      and **customizable** thermal imaging platform that is based on
      **open-source software and hardware**.


      There are **various applications** like finding **heat leaks** in the
      insulation of buildings, the analysis of **electrical** or **mechanical
      components**, the **detection** of **persons** / animals or even mounting
      it on a **drone** and **recording continuous or time-lapse images**.


      Constructed as a **self-assembly solution**, the device allows you to take
      **advantage** of the **versatile possibilities** of thermal imaging.
      **Everything**, from **software** to **hardware**, is completely
      **open-source**! This allows to **modify** or **extend** the
      functionalities of the device to your **own needs**!


      The **DIY-Thermocam V3 self-assembly KIT** contains **all required
      components apart from the FLIR Lepton 2.5/3.5 and the Lepton Breakout
      Board V2**. Check out the **live device video** and the **assembly guide**
      linked below to get a better overview about the device functionalities.
